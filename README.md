===============================

To play the game clone this repo or download it as a zip file and open the index.html file in a modern browser.

As you open it, he Welcome Page will show. You can select your heroe using the arrow keys and press SPACE when you are happy with your choice.

You must avoid water and bugs. If you touch them, you will die. And if you die you'll have to start the level from scratch again.

You can collect extra lives in the game. Look for hearts!!

Your mission is to bring as many gems to the princess as possible. When you decide you have enough gems you can go back to the princess. The current level will be finished and a screen showing your level score and total score will display. Pressing SPACE will initiate the next level.

There are three levels available. They are tough, but I was able to beat them.

If you complete the third level the final screen with the total score will appear. If you press SPACE here, the Welcome Screen will show again.

If you run out of lives the GAME OVER screen will show. If you press SPACE the Welcome Page will show up again.

Hope you enjoy!
